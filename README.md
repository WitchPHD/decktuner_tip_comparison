# decktuner_tip_comparison
 A simple tool for decktuner members to insert recent tips and compare how much they'd make through various platforms. 
 
# What to do
1. Run the program ( either on your own python terminal, or here: https://www.online-python.com/ ). 
2. Input each tip's USD dollar amounts one by one. Hit enter after each one. When you're done inputting, type 'done' and hit enter. Using non-numerical characters (such as $) may terminate the program early.
3. ????
4. Profit

# About the Results
1. BuyMeACoffee results are assuming you have "cover credit card fees" unchecked. Since the pilot/donator is paying the credit card fee, they are also paying the 1.5% international fee. BMAC only allows Stripe (not PayPal). 
2. Ko-Fi (Stripe) also assumes no donations. For international donations, you will end up paying an extra 1.5% international fee on credit card fees, and I have not accounted for this.
3. Ko-Fi (PayPal) is based on the standard fee for receiving donations in United States Dollars (2.89% + 49Â¢). PayPal pricing is actually really complicated, and you may end up spending a decent amount more based on location... and ALSO paying 1.5% international fee.
4. Ko-Fi (Average) averages Ko-Fi (Stripe) and Ko-Fi (PayPal). This is because, unless you disable Stripe or PayPal, you have no control over what % of users donate via which platform. Ko-Fi (Average) is a simple average not intended to account for pilots' donating patterns, but might provide a sample of what donations could look like assuming you have PayPal AND Stripe enabled. 
5. I'd be happy to add more platforms/numbers if tuners are interested.
