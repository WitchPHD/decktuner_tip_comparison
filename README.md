# decktuner_tip_comparison
 A simple tool for decktuner members to insert recent tips and compare how much they'd make through various platforms. 
 
# What to do
1. Run the program (either on your own python terminal, or here: https://www.online-python.com/)Input the number of recent tip amounts you want to input.
2. Input each tip's USD dollar amounts one by one without any special characters. This is a very basic program with next to no error-catching. 
3. ????
4. Profit

# About the Results
1. BuyMeACoffee results are assuming you have "cover credit card fees" unchecked and are posting no donations. BMAC only allows stripe (not paypal). 
2. Ko-Fi (Stripe) also assumes no donations.
3. Ko-Fi (PayPal) is assuming that the formula posted on the website is accurate, but I am regularly charged more than that for my donations. I wish PayPal was more transparent as to why.
4. Remember that on Ko-Fi, unless you disable stripe or paypal, you have no control over what % of users donate via which platform. Ko-Fi average is a simple average not intended to account for pilots' donating patterns. 
5. I'd be happy to add more platforms / numbers if tuners are interested.
