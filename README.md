# decktuner_tip_comparison
 A simple tool for decktuner members to insert recent tips and compare how much they'd make through various platforms. 
 
# What to do
1. Run the program ( either on your own python terminal, or here: https://www.online-python.com/ ). 
2. Input each tip's USD dollar amounts one by one. Hit enter after each one. When you're done inputting, type 'done' and hit enter. Using non-numerical characters (such as $) may terminate the program early.
3. ????
4. Profit

# About the Results
1. BuyMeACoffee results are assuming you have "cover credit card fees" unchecked and you are not donating any % to charity. Since the pilot/donator is paying the credit card fee, they are also paying the 1.5% international fee if applicable, and you are only paying the 5% BMAC fee. BMAC only supports Stripe (not PayPal). 
2. Ko-Fi (Stripe) also assumes you are not donating any % to charity. 
4. Ko-Fi (PayPal) is based on the standard fee for receiving donations in United States Dollars (2.89% + 49Â¢). PayPal donation pricing is actually really complicated, and you may end up spending a decent amount more based on location.
5. Ko-Fi (Stripe - International) is the same as "Ko-Fi (Stripe)" but with the 1.5% international fee. Since you are paying credit card fees, you will have to pay it if the donator is international.
6. Ko-Fi (PayPal - International) is the same as "Ko-Fi (PayPal)" but with the 1.5% international fee. Since you are paying credit card fees, you will have to pay it if the donator is international.
7. Ko-Fi (Average) averages the fees/tips from Stripe and PayPal both internationally and nationally. This is because, unless you disable Stripe or PayPal, you have no control over what % of users donate via which platform... and also, you have no control over what % of users is donating from an international location. Ko-Fi (Average) is a simple average not intended to account for pilots' donating patterns but might provide a sample of what donations could look like assuming you have PayPal AND Stripe enabled. 
8. I'd be happy to add more platforms/numbers if tuners are interested/send me links to said platforms.
