# decktuner_tip_comparison
A simple tool for decktuner members to compare their tips through various platforms.

# What to do
1. Input the number of recent tip amounts you want to input.
2. Input each tip's USD dollar amounts one by one without any special characters.
3. Profit

# About the Results
1. BuyMeACoffee results are assuming you have "cover credit card fees" unchecked and are posting no donations.
2. Ko-Fi (Stripe) also assumes no donations.
3. Ko-Fi (PayPal) is assuming that the formula posted on the website is accurate, but I am regularly charged more than that for my donations. I wish PayPal was more transparent as to why.
